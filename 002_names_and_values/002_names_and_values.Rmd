# Names and values

This section is based on [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2]

## Introduction

- __Goal__: understand the distinction between names and values

- Understand the distinction between an object and its name is helpful because you can:

    + Predict the performance and memory usage of your code
    
    + Write faster code by avoiding accidental copies
    
    + Understand R’s functional programming tools
    
__Quiz__

1. Given the following data frame, how do I create a new column called “3” that contains the sum of 1 and 2? You may only use `$`, not `[[`. What makes 1, 2, and 3 challenging as variable names?

```{r}

set.seed(1234)

df <- data.frame(runif(3), runif(3))
names(df) <- c(1, 2)
print(df)

df$"3" <- df$"1" + df$"2"
print(df)
```
2. In the following code, how much memory does y occupy?

```{r}

set.seed(1234)

x <- runif(1e6)
y <- list(x, x, x)

object.size(x)
object.size(y)
```

- Why `y` is approximately the triple of `x`? 

    + `y` contains copies of `x`
    
3. On which line does a get copied in the following example?

```{r}

a <- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
b <- a
b[[1]] <- 10
```

- I assume that on the second line `b <- a`

## Binding basics

Consider this code:

```{r}
x <- 1:3
```

It’s easy to read it as: __“create an object named ‘x’, containing the values 1, 2, and 3”___. Unfortunately, that’s a simplification that will lead to inaccurate. 

A more accurate description is:

- Creating an object, __a vector of values__, `1:3`

- Binding that object to a __name__, `x`

    + The object (or value) doesn’t have a name. It's actually the name that has a value

To further clarify this distinction let's use a diagram where there is a binding from the name on the left-hand side to the object on the right-hand side:

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.2]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_binding-1.png")
```

For example, if you run this code, you don’t get another copy of the value c(1, 2, 3), you get another binding to the existing object:
 
```{r}

y <- x
```
 

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.2]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_binding-2.png")
```

You might have noticed that the value `1:3` has a label: `0x74b`. While the vector doesn't have a name, we will occasionally need to refer to an object independent of its bindings. To make that possible, we will label values with a unique identifier. You can access an object’s identifier with `lobstr::obj_addr()`:

```{r}

obj_addr(x)
obj_addr(y)
```

### Non-syntactic names

R has strict rules about what constitutes a valid name:

- Must consist of letters, digits, . and _

- Can’t begin with _ or a digit

- You can’t use any of the reserved words like `TRUE`, `NULL`, `if`, and `function`

    + see the complete list in `?Reserved`
    
A name that doesn’t follow these rules is a non-syntactic name. For example:

```{r, error=TRUE}

_abc <- 1
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
if   <- 10
```

It's possible to override these rules and use any name. For example:

```{r }

`_abc` <- 1
`if`   <- 10
```

__Observation__ : You can also create non-syntactic bindings using single or double quotes (e.g. `"_abc" <- 1`) instead of backticks, but you shouldn’t, because you’ll have to use a different syntax to retrieve the values

### Exercises

1. Explain the relationship between a, b, c and d in the following code

```{r}

a <- 1:10
b <- a
c <- b
d <- 1:10
```

- `a <- 1:10` means that `<-` assign the name `a` to the object `1:10` that has an associated identifier where we can access using `lobstr::obj_addr(a)`

    + `obj_addr(a)` gives the address of the value that `a` points to
    
- `b <- a` means that `<-` assign the name `b` to the same object `1:10` where `obj_addr(a)` $=$ `obj_addr(b)`

- `c <- b` means that `<-` assign the name `c` to the same object `1:10` where `obj_addr(b)` $=$ `obj_addr(c)`

```{r}

map_lgl(.x = list(obj_addr(b), 
                  obj_addr(b), 
                  obj_addr(c)), 
        .f = identical, obj_addr(a))
```


- `d <- 1:10` means that `<-` assign the name `d` to the object `1:10` but where `obj_addr(d)` $\neq$ `obj_addr(c)`

```{r}

map_lgl(.x = list(obj_addr(a), 
                  obj_addr(b), 
                  obj_addr(b), 
                  obj_addr(c)), 
        .f = identical, obj_addr(d))
```

2. The following code accesses the mean function in multiple ways. Do they all point to the same underlying function object? Verify this with `lobstr::obj_addr()`

- `mean`
- `base::mean`  
- `get("mean")`
- `evalq(mean)`
- `match.fun("mean")`

Creating all the possible functions $f: A \rightarrow A$ where:

$$A = \{ \text{obj_addr(mean), obj_addr(base::mean), obj_addr(get("mean")), obj_addr(evalq(mean)), obj_addr(match.fun("mean"))} \}$$ 

without including the possibility of $f(a) = a$ where $a \in A$ and verifying if $f(a) \equiv b$

```{r}

map_lgl(.x = list(obj_addr(base::mean), 
                  obj_addr(get("mean")), 
                  obj_addr(evalq(mean)), 
                  obj_addr(match.fun("mean"))), 
        .f = identical, obj_addr(mean))

map_lgl(.x = list(obj_addr(get("mean")), 
                  obj_addr(evalq(mean)), 
                  obj_addr(match.fun("mean"))), 
        .f = identical, obj_addr(base::mean))

map_lgl(.x = list(obj_addr(evalq(mean)), 
                  obj_addr(match.fun("mean"))), 
        .f = identical, obj_addr(get("mean")))

map_lgl(.x = list(obj_addr(match.fun("mean"))), 
        .f = identical, obj_addr(evalq(mean)))
```

3. By default, base R data import functions, like read.csv(), will automatically convert non-syntactic names to syntactic ones. Why might this be problematic? What option allows you to suppress this behavior?

```{r}

# The original names of the columns are: if and _1234
## names of the variables in the data frame are checked to ensure that they are syntactically valid
## and adjusted using  make.names
df_syntactic_name <- read.csv(file = "002_exercise_2_2_2_3.csv",check.names = TRUE)
print(df_syntactic_name)

# names of the variables in the data frame are not checked
df__non_syntactic_name <- read.csv(file = "002_exercise_2_2_2_3.csv", check.names = FALSE)
print(print(df_syntactic_name))

# Using the tidyverse
tbl__non_syntactic_name <- read_csv(file = "002_exercise_2_2_2_3.csv")
print(tbl__non_syntactic_name)
```

- I think it is problematic because maybe you first need the names as they are to identify the variables from a document that explains the defintion of each variable. If they are changed you will be lost.    

4. What rules does `make.names()` use to convert non-syntactic names into syntactic ones?

- According to `?make.names`: 

    + The character "X" is prepended if necessary
    
    + All invalid characters are translated to "."
    
    + A missing value is translated to "NA"
    
    + Names which match R keywords have a dot appended to them
    
    + Duplicated values are altered by `make.unique`
    
```{r}
make.names(".123")
make.names("1$2 3")
make.names(NA)
make.names("for")
make.names(c("for", "for")) %>% make.unique()
```


5. I slightly simplified the rules that govern syntactic names. Why is `.123e1` not a syntactic name? Read `?make.names` for the full details

    + According to `?makenames` "A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters and __starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number.__ Names such as ".2way" are not valid, and neither are the reserved words." 
    
      + Therefore `.123e1` is a non-syntactic name because the dot is follow by number $1$ 

## Copy-on-modify

Consider the following code

```{r}

x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- x



y[3] <- 4

print(x)
print(y)
```

Modifying  `y` clearly didn't modify `x`

__Observation__ In the case of `Python`things are different:

```{python}

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x

y[2] = 4

print(x)
print(y)
```
If you expect the same result in `Python` as in `R` you can do this:

```{python}

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = list(x)

y[2] = 4

print(x)
print(y)
```

While the value associated with `y` changed, the original object did not. Instead, R created a new object, `0xcd2`, a copy of `0x74b` with one value changed, then rebound `y` to that object:

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.3]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_binding-3.png")
```

This behavior is called __copy-on-modify__. However there are important exceptions to copy-on-modify that you’ll learn in the following sections

### `tracemem()`

You can see when an object gets copied with the help of `base::tracemem()`

```{r}

x <- c(1, 2, 3)

tracemem(x)

y <- x

y[3] <- 4

# untracemem() is the opposite of tracemem(); it turns tracing off
untracemem(x)
```

### Function calls

The same rules for copying also apply to function calls. Take this code:

```{r}

f <- function(a) {
  
  a
  
}

x <- 1:3

tracemem(x)

z <- f(x)

untracemem(x)
```

While `f()` is running, the a inside the function points to the same value as the x does outside the function:

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_binding-f1.png")
```
We will learn more about the conventions used in this diagram in __Chapter 7__

Once `f()` completes, `x` and `z` will point to the same object

```{r}

obj_addr(x) == obj_addr(z)
```

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_binding-f2.png")
```

## Lists

It’s not just names (i.e. variables) that point to values: elements of lists do too

```{r}

l1 <- list(1, 2, 3)
```
However lists are more complex because instead of storing values, they store references to them:

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_list.png")
```

For example if you modify a list

```{r}

l2 <- l1

l2[[3]] <- 4
```

Initially you have 

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_l-modify-1.png")
```

But then after the modification you  have

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_l-modify-2.png")
```

Like vectors, lists use copy-on-modify behavior; the original list is left unchanged, and R creates a modified copy. This, however, is a __shallow copy__: the list object and its bindings are copied, but the values pointed to by the bindings are not.

To see values that are shared across lists, use `lobstr::ref()`

```{r}

print(ref(l1, l2))
```

## Data frames

Data frames are lists of vectors, so copy-on-modify has important consequences when you modify a data frame

```{r}

d1 <- data.frame(x = c(1, 5, 6), 
                 y = c(2, 4, 3))
```

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_dataframe.png")
```

If you modify a column, only that column needs to be modified

```{r}

d2 <- d1

d2[, 2] <- d2[, 2] + 1 

print(ref(d1, d2))
```

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_d-modify-c.png")
```

However, if you modify a row, every column is modified:

```{r }

d3 <- d1

d3[2, ] <- d3[2, ] + 1

print(ref(d1, d3))
```

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_d-modify-r.png")
```

### Character vectors

The final place that R uses references is with character vectors

```{r}

x <- c("a", "a", "abc", "d")
```

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.5]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_character.png")
```

But this is a polite fiction. R actually uses a global string pool where each element of a character vector is a pointer to a unique string in the pool

```{r}

include_graphics(path = "002_character-2.png")
```

You can request that `ref()` show these references: 

```{r}

print(ref(x, character = TRUE))
```

### Exercises

1. Why is  `tracemem(1:10)` not useful?

Because `1:10` has not a name associated, so you can't copy `1:10` using `<-` 

2. Explain why `tracemem()` shows two copies when you run this code. Hint: carefully look at the difference between this code and the code shown earlier in the section.

```{r}

x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)

obj_addr(x)

tracemem(x)

x[[3]] <- 4
untracemem(x)

obj_addr(x)
```

- I think that the 2 copies are related to the change of the `class` in the object. Maybe `R` is doing something like this internally:

    + First  `x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)`
    + Second `x <- c(1L, 2L, 4)`
    + Third  `x <- c(1, 2, 4)`
    
Another possibility, pointed out by  `@thisisdaryn (Daryn Ramsden)`, is `c(1, 2, NA)` due to the need to do the type conversion of the values that you're keeping and the necessity to only add one element.       

For example this code only includes one copy because the `class` of the object doesn't change:

```{r}

x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
tracemem(x)

x[[3]] <- 4L
untracemem(x)
```

And this code includes one copies

```{r}

x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
tracemem(x)

x[[10]] <- 4
untracemem(x)
```

However the only way to be sure according to `@thisisdaryn (Daryn Ramsden)`, is to inspect the `C` code for `[[<-`

```{r}

# pryr::show_c_source(.Primitive("[<-"))
```

3. Sketch out the relationship between the following objects:

```{r}

a <- 1:10
b <- list(a, a)
c <- list(b, a, 1:10)
```

```{r}

print(lobstr::ref(c))

print(obj_addr(c))
print(obj_addr(b))
print(obj_addr(a))
```

- First `a` points to the object with the address `r obj_addr(a)`

- Second `b` points to the object with the address `r obj_addr(b)` which contains two objects with the same address `r obj_addr(a)`

- Third `c` points to the object with the address `r obj_addr(b)` which contains 3 objects with 3 different addresses that corresponds to `r obj_addr(b)`, `r obj_addr(a)` and another address that corresponds to an object that is not related with a name

4. What happens when you run this code?

```{r}

x <- list(1:10)

print(ref(x))
```

First `x` points to the object with the address `r obj_addr(x)` which contains an object with the address `r obj_addrs(x)`

```{r}

x[[2]] <- x

print(ref(x))
```

Then `x` now points to the object with the address `r obj_addr(x)` which contains two objects with the addresses `r obj_addrs(x)` because we apply  `x[[2]] <- x`

## Object size

You can find out how much memory an object takes with `lobstr::obj_size()`

__Observation__: Beware of the  `utils::object.size()`  function. It does not correctly account for shared references and will return sizes that are too large

```{r}

obj_size(letters)
obj_size(diamonds)
```

Since the elements of lists are references to values, the size of a list might be much smaller than you expect:

```{r}

x <- 1:10
y <- list(x, x, x, x)

obj_size(x)
obj_size(y)


```

The difference between `y` and `x` is only `r obj_size(y) %>% as.numeric() - obj_size(x) %>% as.numeric()`

Similarly, because R uses a global string pool character vectors take up less memory than you might expect: repeating a string 100 times does not make it take up 100 times as much memory:

```{r}

obj_size("apple")
obj_size(rep(x = "apple", times = 100))
```

References also make it challenging to think about the size of individual objects:

- `obj_size(x) + obj_size(y) = obj_size(x, y)` if there are no shared values

- For example if `x <- 1:10` and `y <- list(x, x, x, x)` the combined size of `x` and `y` is the same as the size of `y`:

```{r}

obj_size(x, y)
```

Finally, R 3.5.0 and later versions have a feature that might lead to surprises: `ALTREP`, short for __alternative representation__. This allows R to represent certain types of vectors very compactly

```{r}

obj_size(1:10)
obj_size(1:10e2)
obj_size(1:10e4)
obj_size(1:10e8)
```

### Exercises

1. In the following example, why are `object.size(y)` and `obj_size(y)` so radically different? Consult the documentation of `object.size()`

```{r}

y <- rep(list(runif(1e4)), 100)

object.size(y)
object.size(runif(1e4))

obj_size(y)
obj_size(runif(1e4))
```

Using `?object.size` you find this: 

_This function merely provides a rough indication: it should be reasonably accurate for atomic vectors, but does not detect if elements of a list are shared. For example sharing among elements of a character vector is taken into account, but not that between character vectors in a single object)_

- In `y <- rep(list(runif(1e4)), 100)` elements in this list are shared

2. Take the following list. Why is its size somewhat misleading?

```{r}

funs <- list(mean, sd, var)
obj_size(funs)
```
First I didn't know the answer so I check out __[Advanced R Solutions](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/)__. According to this source:

_All three functions are built-in to R as part of the base and stats packages and hence always available. We can checkout that this applies to about 2400 objects usually loaded by default_

```{r}

```


```{r}

obj_size(list(mean), list(sd), list(var))

obj_size(list(mean)) + obj_size(list(sd)) + obj_size(list(var)) 
```

3. Predict the output of the following code taking into account that:

```{r}
a <- runif(1e6)
obj_size(a)
```

- `b <- list(a, a)`

  + `obj_size(b)`
  + `obj_size(a, b)`
 
I think that `obj_size(b)` and `obj_size(a, b)` will be approximately equal to `obj_size(a)`
because `b` points to an object that contains 2 equal references pointed out by `a`

```{r}

b <- list(a, a)

obj_size(b)

obj_size(b, a)
obj_sizes(b[[1]], b[[2]], a)
```

- `b[[1]][[1]] <- 10`

  + `obj_size(b)`
  + `obj_size(a, b)`
  
I think that `obj_size(b)` and `obj_size(a, b)` will be greater than `obj_size(b)` because `b[[1]][[1]]` points out to a new object different from what was pointed out initially by `a`

```{r}

b[[1]][[1]] <- 10

obj_size(b)
obj_size(a, b)

obj_sizes(a, b[[1]], b[[2]])
```

- `b[[2]][[1]] <- 10`

  + `obj_size(b)`
  + `obj_size(a, b)`
  
I think that `obj_size(b)` and `obj_size(a, b)` will be even greater than `obj_size(b)` because `b[[1]][[1]]` and `b[[2]][[1]]` points out to 2 new objects that are different from what was pointed out initially by `a`

```{r}

b[[2]][[1]] <- 10

obj_size(b)
obj_size(a, b)

obj_sizes(a, b[[1]], b[[2]])
```

## Modify-in-place

As we’ve seen above, modifying an R object usually creates a copy

- There are two exceptions

    + Objects with a single binding get a special performance optimisation
    
    + Environments, a special type of object, are always modified in place
    
### Objects with a single binding

If an object has a single name bound to it, R will modify it in place. However, complications may arise so it's better to determine it empirically with `tracemem()`:

```{r}

v <- c(1, 2, 3)

obj_addr(v)

v[[3]] <- 4

obj_addr(v)
```

In this case when we apply `v[[3]] <- 4`, R copy the object even if `c(1, 2, 3)` has a single name, `v`, bound to it.

However if you run the same experiment in a script you obtain the result that is pointed out in the book:

```{r}

include_graphics(path = "002_single_binding.png")
```


Let’s explore the subtleties with a case study using for loops. This loop is surprisingly slow because each iteration of the loop copies the data frame:

__Observation__ : These copies are shallow, they only copy the reference to each individual column, not the contents of the columns

```{r}

x <- data.frame(matrix(data = runif(n = 1e4), ncol = 5))
medians <- vapply(X = x, FUN = median, FUN.VALUE = numeric(1))

obj_addr(x)
tracemem(x)

for (i in seq_along(medians)) {

    x[[i]] <- x[[i]] - medians[[i]] 
        
}

untracemem(x)
obj_addr(x)
```

We can reduce the number of copies by using a list instead of a data frame:

```{r}

y <- as.list(x)

obj_addr(y)
tracemem(y)

for (i in seq_along(medians)) {
  
  y[[i]] <- y[[i]] - medians[[i]] 
  
}

obj_addr(y)
untracemem(y)
```

### Environments 

You’ll learn more about environments in Chapter 7, but it’s important to mention them here because their behavior is different from that of other objects: environments are always modified in place

```{r}

e1 <- rlang::env(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
obj_addr(e1)

e2 <- e1
obj_addr(e2)
```

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_e-modify-1.png")
```

If we change a binding, the environment is modified in place

```{r}

e2$c <- 4

obj_addr(e2)
obj_addr(e1)
```

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_e-modify-2.png")
```

One consequence of this is that environments can contain themselves:

```{r}

e <- rlang::env()
e$self <- e

### Exercises

1. Explain why the following code doesn’t create a circular list

- `x <- list()`
- `x[[1]] <- x`

We have the following: 

```{r}

x <- list()

obj_addr(x)
```

First `x` points to the object with the address `r obj_addr(x)`


```{r}

x[[1]] <- x

obj_addr(x)
ref(x)
```

Then `x` points to the object with the address `r obj_addr(x)` and `x[[1]]` points to the object with the address `r obj_addr(x[[1]])` 

2. Wrap the two methods for subtracting medians into two functions, then use the [`bench` package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bench) to carefully compare their speeds. How does performance change as the number of columns increase?

I was not able to understand the function `bench::mark`. Please check out __[Advanced R Solutions](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/)__ to know the answer  

3. What happens if you attempt to use `tracemem()` on an environment?

```{r, error=TRUE}

e1 <- rlang::env(d = 5, e = 6, f = 8)

tracemem(e1)

e2 <- e1

e2$f <- 9
e1$d <- 4

untracemem(e1)


```

You get an error as you can verify above

## Unbinding and the garbage collector

Consider this code:

```{r}

x <- 1:3
```

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.6]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_binding-1.png")
```

```{r}

x <- 2:4
```

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.6]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_unbinding-2.png")
```

```{r}

rm(x)
```

```{r fig.cap="Source: [@wickham_advanced_2019, Chapter 2, Section 2.6]"}

include_graphics(path = "002_unbinding-3.png")
```

We created two objects, but by the time the code finishes, neither object is bound to a name. How do these objects get deleted? That’s the job of the __garbage collector__, or GC for short

- The __garbage collector__ (GC) attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by a program

The __garbage collector__ (GC) runs automatically whenever R needs more memory to create a new object. Looking from the outside, it’s basically impossible to predict when the GC will run

You can use `base::gc()` to causes a garbage collection to take place:

```{r}

gc()
```

Also you can use `lobstr::mem_used()` to see the exact number of bytes currently used by R

```{r}

lobstr::mem_used()
```

This number won’t agree with the amount of memory reported by your operating system:

- It includes objects created by R but not by the R interpreter

- Both R and the operating system are lazy: they won't reclaim memory until it's actually needed. R might be holding on to memory because the OS hasn't yet asked for it back

- R counts the memory occupied by objects but there may be empty gaps due to deleted objects. This problem is known as memory fragmentation
